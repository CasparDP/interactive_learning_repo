# Software Company Case

A software company sells a 3-year enterprise software license for €300,000 with installation services (€50,000) and annual maintenance (€30,000/year). The installation takes 2 months.

## Question 1

What are the distinct performance obligations in this contract?

- One obligation: Complete software package with installation and maintenance
- Two obligations: (1) Software with installation, (2) Maintenance services
- Three obligations: (1) Software license, (2) Installation services, (3) Maintenance services **(correct)**
- Four obligations: (1) Software license, (2) Installation services, (3) First-year maintenance, (4) Years 2-3 maintenance

**Explanation**: This case illustrates multiple performance obligations with different revenue recognition patterns. Under IFRS 15, we identify separate performance obligations when goods or services are distinct. The software license transfers immediately (point in time), installation services are recognized over the installation period, and maintenance is recognized over the 3-year service period.

## Question 2

When should revenue for the software license be recognized?

- Immediately when the contract is signed **(correct)**
- Over the 2-month installation period
- Over the 3-year license period
- Only when all services have been completed after 3 years

**Explanation**: Under IFRS 15, the software license transfers immediately (point in time), so revenue for the license should be recognized when the contract is signed.

## Question 3

How should revenue for the maintenance services be recognized?

- Immediately when the contract is signed
- After installation is complete
- Over the 3-year period as the services are provided **(correct)**
- In 3 equal amounts at the end of each year

**Explanation**: Maintenance is recognized over the 3-year service period as the services are continuously provided to the customer.

# Construction Contract Case

A construction company signs a €5 million contract to build a custom office building. The project will take 2 years to complete. The customer controls the asset as it's being built on their land.

## Question 1

How should the construction company recognize revenue on this project?

- Only when the building is complete and handed over
- In two equal installments at the end of each year
- Over time as the construction progresses **(correct)**
- When the contract is first signed

**Explanation**: Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion when the customer controls the asset as it's being created. Since the building is on the customer's land, they control it as it's being built.

## Question 2

If the company has completed 30% of the work by the end of year 1 and incurred 40% of the costs, what's the appropriate revenue to recognize for year 1?

- €2 million (40% of contract value)
- €1.5 million (30% of contract value) **(correct)**
- Zero until the project is complete
- Depends on milestone completion rather than percentage

**Explanation**: Progress is measured based on the proportion of performance obligation satisfied (30%), not necessarily based on costs incurred (40%). Therefore, 30% of the contract value should be recognized.

## Question 3

If the customer pays a €1 million advance at the start of the project, how should this be recorded?

- As revenue immediately
- As a contract liability (deferred revenue) **(correct)**
- As a reduction of the total contract price
- As a separate financing transaction

**Explanation**: Advances are recorded as contract liabilities until the performance obligation is satisfied. The company has an obligation to perform construction services with this advance payment.

# Mobile Telecom Case

A telecom company offers a contract: €1 upfront for a premium smartphone (standalone value €700) with a 24-month service plan at €40/month. The standalone price for the service plan alone would be €30/month.

## Question 1

What is the total transaction price in this contract?

- €1 (the upfront payment)
- €701 (phone price plus upfront fee)
- €721 (€1 + 24 months × €30)
- €961 (€1 + 24 months × €40) **(correct)**

**Explanation**: The total transaction price is the sum of all consideration promised in the contract: €1 upfront payment plus €40 per month for 24 months equals €961.

## Question 2

How should the transaction price be allocated between the phone and the service?

- €1 to phone, €960 to service
- €700 to phone, €261 to service
- Based on their relative standalone selling prices **(correct)**
- €700 to phone, €960 to service (no allocation needed)

**Explanation**: Under IFRS 15, when a contract includes multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated based on relative standalone selling prices. The standalone prices are €700 for the phone and €720 (€30 × 24) for the service plan.

## Question 3

What amount of revenue should be recognized when the customer first signs up and receives the phone?

- €1 (the upfront payment)
- €700 (standalone value of the phone)
- Approximately €475 (allocation based on relative standalone values) **(correct)**
- €0 (defer all revenue until service period)

**Explanation**: This case showcases a multi-element arrangement requiring allocation of the transaction price. For the phone: (€700 ÷ (€700 + €720)) × €961 ≈ €475. For the service: (€720 ÷ (€700 + €720)) × €961 ≈ €486. The €475 for the phone should be recognized immediately when the customer receives it.
