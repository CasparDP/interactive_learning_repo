# Interactive Learning Repository

This repository contains interactive learning components designed to complement the my teaching, e.g. Financial Reporting & Analysis lectures. These tools offer hands-on practice with key accounting concepts through scenario-based exercises and visual frameworks.

## Purpose

These interactive components aim to bridge the gap between accounting theory and practical application. Each tool allows you to test your understanding of complex accounting concepts in a structured, feedback-rich environment.

## Important Notes

- **Experimental Nature**: These components are part of ongoing pedagogical experimentation to enhance the learning experience. They may be refined throughout the semester.

- **Development Status**: While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, these tools are continuously evolving. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know.

- **Supplement, Not Replacement**: These interactive elements are designed to complement lectures and assigned readings, not replace them. Always refer to authoritative texts and standards for definitive information on accounting principles.

- **Best Experience**: For optimal performance, access these components using a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific component related to the lecture topic you're studying
2. Read scenario descriptions carefully
3. Work through exercises at your own pace
4. Use the immediate feedback to refine your understanding
5. Revisit components as needed when preparing for assessments
