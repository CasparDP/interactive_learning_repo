# Financial Reporting & Analysis: Lectures 1-4 Review Quiz

This section contains warm-up questions to recap the key concepts from lecture 1, 2, 3, and 4. These questions are designed to help you review and reinforce your understanding of the material covered in the lectures.

## Question 1

Which of the following statements best describes the matching principle in accounting?

- Revenues should match expenses in each accounting period
- Assets must equal liabilities plus equity at all times
- Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they helped to generate **(correct)**
- Financial statements must match across consecutive reporting periods

**Explanation**: The matching principle is a fundamental accounting concept that requires expenses to be recognized in the same accounting period as the revenues they helped generate. This ensures that the income statement accurately reflects the relationship between business efforts (expenses) and accomplishments (revenues) within a specific time period, providing a more meaningful measure of performance than simply tracking cash flows.

## Question 2

In the Advanced DuPont Analysis framework, what does the SPREAD component represent?

- The difference between current assets and current liabilities
- The difference between a company's RNOA and its Net Borrowing Cost **(correct)**
- The spread of sales across different market segments
- The time spread between recognizing revenue and collecting cash

**Explanation**: In the Advanced DuPont Analysis, SPREAD represents the difference between a company's Return on Net Operating Assets (RNOA) and its Net Borrowing Cost (NBC). When positive, it indicates that the company is generating returns from its operations that exceed the cost of its debt financing. This is a crucial component in understanding how financial leverage affects Return on Equity (ROE).

## Question 3

Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between ROE, RNOA, and financial leverage in the Advanced DuPont Analysis?

- ROE = RNOA + (FLEV × SPREAD) **(correct)**
- ROE = RNOA - (FLEV × SPREAD)
- ROE = RNOA × FLEV
- ROE = RNOA ÷ FLEV

**Explanation**: In the Advanced DuPont Analysis, Return on Equity (ROE) equals Return on Net Operating Assets (RNOA) plus the product of Financial Leverage (FLEV) and SPREAD. This equation shows that companies can enhance ROE either by improving their operating performance (RNOA) or by effectively using financial leverage when SPREAD is positive (i.e., when RNOA exceeds the cost of debt).

## Question 4

What does a negative cash conversion cycle indicate about a company's working capital management?

- The company is inefficient at managing its inventory and receivables
- The company takes longer to pay its suppliers than to sell inventory and collect from customers
- The company is effectively using supplier financing, allowing it to receive cash from customers before paying suppliers **(correct)**
- The company is experiencing severe liquidity problems

**Explanation**: A negative cash conversion cycle indicates highly efficient working capital management where a company is effectively using supplier financing. It means the company receives cash from its customers before it has to pay its suppliers, essentially using suppliers as a source of interest-free financing. This was demonstrated in the lecture when examining Inditex's working capital management compared to H&M.

## Question 5

Which of the following is considered a driver of Net Operating Asset Turnover (ATO)?

- Days' receivables **(correct)**
- Dividend payout ratio
- Interest coverage ratio
- Tax rate

**Explanation**: Days' receivables is a driver of Net Operating Asset Turnover (ATO) because it affects how efficiently a company converts its investment in receivables into sales. Lower days' receivables means faster collection, which improves the operating asset turnover. Other drivers include days' inventory, days' payables, and PP&E turnover. The dividend payout ratio, interest coverage ratio, and tax rate are not direct drivers of ATO.

## Question 6

In the investor approach to financial statement analysis, why is Return on Net Operating Assets (RNOA) considered a better measure of operating profitability than the traditional Return on Total Assets (ROTA)?

- RNOA excludes financial assets and liabilities, focusing solely on operating performance **(correct)**
- RNOA is calculated after tax while ROTA is calculated before tax
- RNOA can never be negative while ROTA sometimes is
- RNOA is required by accounting standards while ROTA is optional

**Explanation**: RNOA provides a cleaner measure of operating profitability because it excludes financial assets and liabilities, focusing solely on the performance of operating activities. Unlike ROTA (which includes financial assets in its base and excludes operating liabilities), RNOA properly separates operating and financing activities. This distinction is crucial because it allows analysts to evaluate a company's core business performance without the distorting effects of financing decisions, providing insight into the true value-creating activities of the business.

## Question 7

What does the Minority Sharing Ratio (MSR) measure in the context of Advanced DuPont Analysis?

- The percentage of equity owned by minority shareholders
- The proportion of dividends paid to minority shareholders
- The ratio of common shareholders' share of income to their share of equity **(correct)**
- The percentage of operating income attributable to minority interests

**Explanation**: The Minority Sharing Ratio (MSR) measures how the common shareholders' share of group income relates to their share of group equity. It captures whether common shareholders are receiving a disproportionate share of profits relative to their ownership stake. When MSR > 1, common shareholders are earning a greater share of income relative to their ownership percentage; when MSR < 1, they're earning less than proportionate returns.

## Question 8

When a company reports higher Operating Income (OI) than Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) over multiple periods, this most likely indicates:

- The company is experiencing rapid growth in working capital needs
- The company is making frequent acquisitions
- The company may be engaging in aggressive earnings management practices **(correct)**
- The company is efficiently managing its operating assets

**Explanation**: When Operating Income consistently exceeds Free Cash Flow from Operations over multiple periods, it suggests potential earnings quality issues. This discrepancy indicates a significant accrual component in earnings, which could reflect aggressive revenue recognition, delayed expense recognition, or working capital inefficiencies. This pattern is a warning sign that the company's accounting earnings may be less sustainable than they appear.

# Review of Lecture 5 (Cash Flows, Forecasting and Valuation)

This section covers the key concepts from lecture 5, focusing on key aspects of cash flows, forecasting techniques, and valuation methods.These questions are designed to help you review and reinforce your understanding of the material covered in the lecture.

## Question 1

The accrual anomaly in accounting research refers to:

- Discrepancies between reported cash flows and actual bank balances
- The tendency of companies with high accruals to experience lower future stock returns **(correct)**
- Errors in accrual accounting that require financial statement restatements
- The inability of analysts to accurately forecast accruals

**Explanation**: The accrual anomaly refers to the empirical finding that companies with high accruals (large differences between earnings and cash flows) tend to experience lower future stock returns compared to companies with low accruals. This suggests that investors don't fully incorporate the information contained in accruals when valuing stocks. Companies with high accruals may have lower earnings quality or less sustainable profits, which eventually gets reflected in future performance.

## Question 2

Using the relationship between financial statements, Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) can be expressed as:

- Net Income + Depreciation + Changes in Working Capital - Capital Expenditures
- Operating Income (OI) - Change in Net Operating Assets (ΔNOA) **(correct)**
- Net Income - Interest Expense - Changes in Accounts Receivable and Inventory
- Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance Capital Expenditures

**Explanation**: The lecture demonstrated that Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) can be expressed as Operating Income (OI) minus the Change in Net Operating Assets (ΔNOA). This formula highlights the relationship between accrual-based operating performance (OI) and the investment in operating assets needed to support that performance. It also reveals that when operating income exceeds the investment in net operating assets, the company generates positive free cash flow. This relationship is derived from the articulation between the income statement and balance sheet, and provides a direct way to identify the accrual component of earnings.

## Question 3

In the residual earnings valuation model, which of the following represents the correct formula?

- Value of Equity = Book Value of Equity + PV of Future Dividends
- Value of Equity = Book Value of Equity + PV of Future Free Cash Flows
- Value of Equity = Book Value of Equity + PV of Future Residual Earnings **(correct)**
- Value of Equity = Book Value of Equity + PV of Future Sales Growth

**Explanation**: The residual earnings valuation model expresses equity value as the sum of current book value plus the present value of expected future residual earnings. Residual earnings are defined as reported earnings minus a capital charge (the required return multiplied by beginning book value). This model highlights that a company creates value only when it generates returns that exceed the cost of capital on its invested equity.

## Question 4

When forecasting financial statements, which of the following approaches most closely aligns with the Advanced DuPont framework?

- Forecast sales growth first, then use historical profit margins to project expenses
- Start with a target ROE and work backward to determine required sales and expenses
- Forecast sales first, then use projected ATO to forecast NOA, and then use PM to forecast Operating Income **(correct)**
- Begin by forecasting cash flows, then derive income statement and balance sheet items

**Explanation**: The lecture presented a structured approach to forecasting that aligns with the Advanced DuPont framework. It begins by forecasting sales, then uses projected Asset Turnover (ATO) to forecast Net Operating Assets (NOA), and then uses Profit Margin (PM) to forecast Operating Income. This approach ensures consistency between projected growth (sales) and the assets required to support that growth, while maintaining the fundamental relationships highlighted in DuPont analysis.

## Question 5

How can you identify the accrual component of earnings using the FCFO formula?

- Accrual component = Net Income - Operating Cash Flow
- Accrual component = Change in Net Operating Assets **(correct)**
- Accrual component = Depreciation + Change in Working Capital
- Accrual component = Operating Income - Interest Expense

**Explanation**: Using the relationship FCFO = OI - ΔNOA (Free Cash Flow from Operations = Operating Income - Change in Net Operating Assets), we can rearrange to see that ΔNOA = OI - FCFO. This reveals that the Change in Net Operating Assets represents the accrual component of earnings. When a company's change in net operating assets is positive, it means that accrual-based operating income exceeds the cash generated from operations.

## Question 6

Which of the following statements about the Residual Earnings Valuation model versus the Discounted Cash Flow model is correct?

- The Residual Earnings model can only be applied to companies with stable dividend policies, while DCF works for all companies
- The DCF model always produces higher valuations because it incorporates the time value of money, which Residual Earnings models ignore
- Both models will yield identical valuations when applied correctly with consistent assumptions, including the same cost of capital, growth rates, and forecast horizon **(correct)**
- The Residual Earnings model is primarily useful for valuing financial institutions, while the DCF model is better suited for industrial companies

**Explanation**: When applied correctly with consistent assumptions (including identical cost of capital, growth rates, and forecast horizons), the Residual Earnings Valuation model and the Discounted Cash Flow model will yield identical equity valuations. This mathematical equivalence occurs because both models are derived from the same fundamental concept: the value of equity equals the present value of expected future cash flows to shareholders. While they may appear different in structure and implementation, with the Residual Earnings model explicitly incorporating book values as a starting point, they are essentially different ways of expressing the same underlying valuation principle.

## Question 7

Which of the following multiples is most likely to be affected by differences in accounting for R&D expenses across companies?

- Price-to-Book ratio **(correct)**
- Price-to-Sales ratio
- EV/EBITDA ratio
- Dividend Yield

**Explanation**: The Price-to-Book ratio is most sensitive to differences in R&D accounting because R&D expenditures are typically expensed rather than capitalized under current accounting standards. Companies with significant R&D investments will have understated book values, leading to inflated P/B ratios compared to companies with similar economic value but fewer R&D investments. This accounting distortion makes P/B ratios difficult to compare across R&D-intensive and non-R&D-intensive companies or across countries with different accounting treatments for R&D.

## Question 8

According to empirical evidence presented in the lectures, if a company has extremely high RNOA in the current year, what is the most likely pattern for its RNOA over the next five years?

- It will likely increase even further due to momentum effects
- It will likely remain exactly the same due to sustainable competitive advantages
- It will likely decrease toward industry averages due to competitive forces **(correct)**
- It will likely fluctuate randomly with no discernible pattern

**Explanation**: Empirical evidence from time-series analysis shows that companies with extremely high RNOA tend to experience "mean reversion" over time, with their RNOA gradually declining toward industry averages. This pattern reflects the economic reality that abnormally high returns attract competition, which eventually erodes competitive advantages. Understanding this mean-reverting tendency is crucial for forecasting a company's future performance and developing realistic valuation models that don't simply extrapolate current extreme levels of profitability indefinitely into the future.
