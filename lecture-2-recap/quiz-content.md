# Warm Up questions Lecture 1

This section contains warm-up questions to recap the key concepts from lecture 1, again.

## Question 1

Which of the following accounting relationships is ALWAYS true?

- Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue
- Assets + Liabilities = Equity
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue - Expenses **(correct)**
- Assets - Liabilities = Equity + Revenue

**Explanation**: The expanded accounting equation incorporates income statement elements: Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue - Expenses. This reflects how net income (Revenue - Expenses) flows into equity through retained earnings, maintaining the balance sheet's fundamental structure while accounting for all business activities.

## Question 2

Which accounting principle best explains why companies recognize inventory purchases as assets rather than expenses when acquired?

- Cost principle
- Matching principle **(correct)**
- Full disclosure principle
- Materiality principle

**Explanation**: The matching principle requires that expenses be recognized in the same period as the revenues they helped generate. When inventory is purchased, it's recorded as an asset because its cost hasn't yet been matched with revenue. Only when inventory is sold does its cost become an expense (cost of goods sold) that matches with the related revenue, following the matching principle.

## Question 3

What makes accrual accounting a more reliable indicator of firm performance than cash flows according to lecture 1?

- It recognizes income tax obligations more accurately
- It records only verified cash transactions
- It removes unpredictable cash flow shocks from earnings **(correct)**
- It accelerates revenue recognition compared to cash accounting

**Explanation**: Accrual accounting makes profits a better measure of firm performance than cash flows because it removes unpredictable cash flow shocks. The lecture demonstrated that current operating profits explain more variation in future operating profits than operating cash flows, making accrual-based measures more predictive of future performance.

## Question 4

In the context of information problems discussed in lecture 1, accrual accounting addresses:

- Auditor independence concerns
- Tax compliance requirements
- Information asymmetry between managers and stakeholders **(correct)**
- Internal control weakness identification

**Explanation**: Accrual accounting addresses information asymmetry issues between managers (who have internal information) and external stakeholders by providing a more comprehensive economic picture of the firm. By systematically recognizing revenues when earned and expenses when incurred, accrual accounting reduces information gaps, providing external users with insights closer to management's internal view of company performance.

# Revenue Recognition (IFRS 15)

This section covers revenue recognition principles under IFRS 15, discussed during lecture 2.

## Question 5

A software company sells a perpetual license for €50,000 that includes first-year essential technical support and updates. The standalone selling price for the license is €45,000 and for the support is €10,000. Under IFRS 15, how much revenue should be recognized for the license component at the point of sale, assuming the support is delivered over time?

- €50,000
- €45,000
- €40,909 **(correct)**
- €38,500

**Explanation**: Using the relative standalone selling price method: Total standalone value = €45,000 + €10,000 = €55,000. Allocation to license = €50,000 × (€45,000 ÷ €55,000) = €40,909. Allocation to support = €50,000 × (€10,000 ÷ €55,000) = €9,091. This follows IFRS 15's allocation requirement for multiple performance obligations.

## Question 6

Company X enters into a contract to build a specialized manufacturing facility for a customer over 30 months for €12 million. Which of the following would most likely indicate that revenue should be recognized over time rather than at a point in time?

- The facility uses common construction techniques
- Payment is due upon completion
- The facility has no alternative use to Company X and it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date **(correct)**
- The customer can inspect the work at any time

**Explanation**: Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized over time when one of three criteria is met, including when the asset has no alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. This specialized facility with these contractual terms would therefore qualify for over-time recognition under paragraph 35(c) of IFRS 15.

## Question 7

A mobile phone company sells a two-year plan for €720, including a phone (standalone value €350) and service (standalone monthly value €25). When the customer pays upfront and receives the phone immediately, the company should recognize:

- A contract asset of €120
- A contract liability of €120 **(correct)**
- A contract asset of €230
- A contract liability of €230

**Explanation**: Total standalone value = €350 + (24 × €25) = €950. Allocation: Phone = €720 × (€350 ÷ €950) = €265. Service = €720 × (€600 ÷ €950) = €455. Since €720 is received upfront but only €265 is earned immediately (phone), a contract liability of €455 is created. After accounting for the phone delivery, the remaining contract liability is €455, not €120 (which would be if the phone were valued at cost rather than its allocated transaction price).

## Question 8

Construction Company Y uses the percentage-of-completion method for a €10 million project. In year 1, it incurs €2 million in costs with total expected costs of €8 million. During year 2, the total expected costs are revised to €9 million and additional costs of €3 million are incurred. How much revenue should be recognized in year 2?

- €2.22 million
- €3.06 million **(correct)**
- €3.75 million
- €5 million

**Explanation**: Year 1: Percentage complete = €2M ÷ €8M = 25%. Revenue recognized = 25% × €10M = €2.5M. Year 2: New percentage complete = (€2M + €3M) ÷ €9M = 55.56%. Total revenue to date = 55.56% × €10M = €5.556M. Revenue in Year 2 = €5.556M - €2.5M = €3.056M (rounded to €3.06M for simplicity). This demonstrates how changes in cost estimates affect revenue recognition under the percentage-of-completion method.

# Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

This section covers the topic Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, discussed briefly during lecture 2. You should all be familiar with this topic from your first year accounting course. If not, please review the topic.

## Question 9

Company Z uses the aging method for estimating bad debts. At year-end, its accounts receivable aging analysis shows:

Current: €300,000 (1% uncollectible),

1-30 days: €150,000 (3% uncollectible),

31-60 days: €80,000 (10% uncollectible),

Over 60 days: €40,000 (25% uncollectible).

If the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a credit balance of €5,000 before adjustment, what should be the bad debt expense for the period?

- €3,000
- €16,500
- €11,500 **(correct)**
- €21,500

**Explanation**: Required allowance = (€300,000 × 1%) + (€150,000 × 3%) + (€80,000 × 10%) + (€40,000 × 25%) = €3,000 + €4,500 + €8,000 + €10,000 = €25,500. Since there's already a €5,000 credit balance in the allowance account, the adjustment needed is €25,500 - €5,000 = €20,500. Therefore, Bad Debt Expense of €20,500 should be recognized.

## Question 10

On January 1, Company A had accounts receivable of €500,000 and an allowance for doubtful accounts of €35,000. During the year, the company had credit sales of €1,200,000, collections of €1,150,000, and wrote off €32,000 of uncollectible accounts. On December 31, if the company estimates that 4% of its ending accounts receivable will be uncollectible, what is the bad debt expense for the year?

- €17,000
- €20,720 **(correct)**
- €29,920
- €32,000

**Explanation**: Ending Accounts Receivable = €500,000 + €1,200,000 - €1,150,000 - €32,000 = €518,000. Required ending allowance = 4% × €518,000 = €20,720. Existing allowance = €35,000 - €32,000 = €3,000 (after write-offs). Adjustment needed = €20,720 - €3,000 = €17,720. Therefore, Bad Debt Expense = €17,720.

## Question 11

A customer who previously had a €15,000 account written off as uncollectible unexpectedly pays the full amount. The company uses the allowance method. What effect will this recovery have on the company's net income?

- Increase by €15,000
- No effect **(correct)**
- Increase by €30,000
- Decrease by €15,000

**Explanation**: Under the allowance method, when a recovery occurs, the company first reverses the write-off (Debit Accounts Receivable, Credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for €15,000), then records the cash receipt (Debit Cash, Credit Accounts Receivable for €15,000). This increases the Allowance account but doesn't affect current period expenses. The recovery increases assets but has no direct impact on net income because bad debt expense was recognized in a prior period.

## Question 12

Which statement accurately describes the financial statement effect of writing off a specific customer's account as uncollectible using the allowance method?

- It decreases total assets and increases expenses
- It decreases total assets but has no effect on net income **(correct)**
- It has no effect on total assets but decreases net income
- It decreases both total assets and net income by equal amounts

**Explanation**: When a specific account is written off using the allowance method, Accounts Receivable (an asset) decreases and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra-asset) decreases by the same amount. This reduces both the gross receivables and the allowance by equal amounts, resulting in a decrease in total assets (since gross receivables decrease) but with no change to net receivables. There's no income statement effect since bad debt expense was previously recognized when the allowance was established.

# Earnings Management

This section covers earnings management concepts discussed during lecture 2.

## Question 13

Which of the following activities would most likely be considered "real" earnings management rather than "accrual-based" earnings management?

- Changing the estimated useful life of fixed assets
- Adjusting the allowance for doubtful accounts percentage
- Delaying planned R&D projects until the next fiscal year **(correct)**
- Releasing previous restructuring reserves to boost current income

**Explanation**: Real earnings management involves actual operational decisions that affect cash flows, like delaying R&D projects. Accrual-based earnings management involves manipulating accounting estimates or policies without changing real economic activities. The other three options are accrual-based adjustments that don't alter actual business operations but only how they're recorded.

## Question 14

A company is close to violating its debt covenant that requires maintaining a debt-to-equity ratio below 2.0. According to positive accounting theory, which earnings management approach is the company most likely to pursue?

- Income-decreasing choices to negotiate better terms
- Income-increasing choices to boost equity **(correct)**
- Conservative accounting regardless of the impact on covenants
- Delaying earnings announcements until covenant terms are renegotiated

**Explanation**: According to the debt covenant hypothesis in positive accounting theory, companies approaching covenant violations have incentives to make income-increasing accounting choices. Higher reported income increases equity through retained earnings, which would improve the debt-to-equity ratio and help avoid covenant violation.

## Question 15

Which of the following actions most clearly demonstrates "income smoothing" as an earnings management technique?

- Writing off all underperforming assets in a single period
- Accelerating discretionary expenses like maintenance when quarterly earnings exceed targets **(correct)**
- Delaying revenue recognition until the next fiscal year
- Changing from straight-line to accelerated depreciation

**Explanation**: Income smoothing involves making accounting choices that reduce income in good periods and increase it in bad periods, creating a more consistent earnings trend. Accelerating discretionary expenses when earnings are above expectations reduces current period income to save it for future periods, smoothing the earnings pattern. The other options either consistently reduce income or represent one-time accounting changes rather than systematic smoothing practices.

## Question 16

The CEO's compensation package includes a bonus if the company meets an earnings target of €10 million. Current projections show earnings will be €9.8 million. Which earnings management technique below would be LEAST likely to be investigated by auditors?

- Extending the useful life of several major assets
- Capitalizing certain marketing costs that were previously expensed
- Selling unused property that has appreciated in value **(correct)**
- Releasing part of a litigation reserve established in the prior year

**Explanation**: Selling appreciated property is a real business decision with legitimate economic substance, making it harder for auditors to question compared to changes in accounting estimates or policies. While the timing may be motivated by earnings targets, the transaction itself has genuine business purpose and the gain recognition follows proper accounting standards. The other options involve more subjective accounting judgments that auditors are likely to scrutinize more closely.
