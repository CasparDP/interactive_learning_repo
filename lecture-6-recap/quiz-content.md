# Liabilities and Credit Analysis

This section covers the key concepts from lecture 6, focusing on key aspects of liabilities and credit analysis. These questions are designed to help you review and reinforce your understanding of the material covered in the lecture.

## Question 1

When a bond is issued at a discount (below par value), what is the relationship between the coupon rate and the market interest rate?

- The coupon rate equals the market interest rate
- The coupon rate is higher than the market interest rate
- The coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate **(correct)**
- There is no consistent relationship between coupon rate and market interest rate

**Explanation**: When a bond is issued at a discount (below par value), it means that the coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate. Investors are unwilling to pay the full face value because the stated interest payments are lower than what they could earn elsewhere at the market rate. The discount compensates investors for accepting a below-market coupon rate.

## Question 2

What happens to a bond discount over the life of the bond when using effective interest rate amortization?

- The discount increases over time
- The discount decreases over time and eventually becomes zero at maturity **(correct)**
- The discount remains constant throughout the bond's life
- The discount converts to a premium halfway through the bond's life

**Explanation**: When a bond is issued at a discount, the discount is amortized (gradually reduced) over the life of the bond using the effective interest method. This amortization increases the carrying value of the bond liability each period until it reaches the face value at maturity. The amortization represents additional interest expense beyond the cash coupon payments.

## Question 3

How does an installment loan differ from a bond in terms of principal repayment?

- Installment loans require principal repayment only at maturity, while bonds require periodic principal payments
- Installment loans require periodic principal payments throughout the loan term, while bonds typically repay principal at maturity **(correct)**
- Installment loans and bonds have identical principal repayment patterns
- Installment loans never require principal repayments, only interest payments

**Explanation**: In an installment loan, both principal and interest are paid in regular installments throughout the loan term, with each payment reducing the outstanding principal balance. In contrast, most bonds pay periodic interest (coupon payments) during the bond's life but return the entire principal (face value) at maturity in a single payment. This fundamental difference affects the pattern of cash flows and balance sheet presentation over time.

## Question 4

If a company issues a bond with a face value of €1,000, but receives proceeds of €950, how will this affect the company's interest expense compared to the coupon payments?

- Interest expense will equal coupon payments
- Interest expense will be less than coupon payments
- Interest expense will be greater than coupon payments **(correct)**
- Interest expense will be unrelated to coupon payments

**Explanation**: When a bond is issued at a discount (€950 for a €1,000 face value bond), the interest expense recognized each period will be greater than the cash coupon payments. This is because interest expense includes both the coupon payment plus the amortization of the discount. The effective interest method ensures that the total interest expense over the life of the bond equals the difference between the cash received (€950) and the total cash paid out (coupon payments plus €1,000 at maturity).

## Question 5

How does the effective yield (yield to maturity) of a bond relate to the perceived credit risk of the issuer?

- Higher effective yield indicates lower perceived credit risk
- Higher effective yield indicates higher perceived credit risk **(correct)**
- Effective yield is unrelated to perceived credit risk
- Effective yield only reflects market interest rates, not credit risk

**Explanation**: The effective yield (or yield to maturity) has a direct relationship with perceived credit risk. Investors demand higher returns for taking on greater risk. Therefore, bonds with higher credit risk trade at lower prices, resulting in higher effective yields. This risk premium compensates investors for the increased probability of default associated with riskier issuers.

## Question 6

What does the "funded status" represent in the context of defined benefit pension plans?

- The percentage of pension plan assets that are invested in stocks versus bonds
- The percentage of employee salaries contributed to the pension plan annually
- The difference between pension plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation **(correct)**
- The amount of cash the company has set aside for future pension contributions

**Explanation**: The funded status represents the difference between the pension plan assets (at fair value) and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). If the funded status is negative (plan assets < PBO), the company must recognize a pension liability on its balance sheet. If the funded status is positive (plan assets > PBO), the company may recognize a pension asset, subject to certain limitations.

## Question 7

Which of the following best represents the primary drivers of debt value in credit analysis?

- Current ratio and quick ratio
- Equity buffer, expected return on assets, and volatility of returns **(correct)**
- Earnings per share and dividend yield
- Geographic diversification and market share

**Explanation**: When analyzing debt value and creditworthiness, three fundamental drivers are typically considered: (1) the current equity buffer (how much enterprise value exceeds debt, providing a cushion before default), (2) expected return/change in enterprise value (indicating future capacity to service debt), and (3) volatility in returns (reflecting the risk that actual returns might fall below expectations). These factors directly impact the probability of default and therefore the value of debt securities.

## Question 8

When comparing financial statement-based credit scores (like Altman Z-score) with market-based credit assessment approaches, which statement is most accurate?

- Financial statement-based approaches provide real-time assessments that market-based approaches cannot
- Financial statement-based approaches inherently capture volatility measures that market-based approaches miss
- Market-based approaches potentially incorporate a broader set of information beyond what appears in financial statements **(correct)**
- Market-based approaches are less subject to estimation error than financial statement-based approaches

**Explanation**: Market-based credit assessment approaches incorporate information from security prices, which reflect the market's comprehensive assessment of a company's financial health. This can include information beyond what appears in financial statements, such as industry trends, management quality, competitive position, and future growth prospects. Financial statement-based credit scores are limited to information contained in accounting reports, which represent only a subset of all available information and are published relatively infrequently (quarterly or annually).
