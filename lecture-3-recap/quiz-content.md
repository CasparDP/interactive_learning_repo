# Warm Up questions Lecture 1 + 2

This section contains warm-up questions to recap the key concepts from lecture 1 and lecture 2.

## Question 1

According to Lecture 1, when information asymmetry and conflicts of interest exist in capital markets, which of the following mechanisms does accrual accounting specifically provide to address these challenges?

- It eliminates all risks for investors, providing perfect information about future cash flows
- It allows managers to transfer wealth to stakeholders by deferring losses to future periods
- It provides a standardized framework that transforms unpredictable cash flows into more persistent and informative profit measures by matching expenses to related revenues **(correct)**
- It ensures that all business activities are recorded at their fair market value, eliminating any potential for misvaluation

**Explanation**: Lecture 1 explains that accrual accounting addresses information problems through a standardized framework that transforms potentially unpredictable cash flows into more informative and persistent accrual-based profit measures. By applying the matching principle, accrual accounting allocates cash flows to appropriate periods, recording revenues when earned and expenses when incurred. This reduces information asymmetry by providing external stakeholders with a more complete view of economic performance than mere cash flows would show. The evidence presented in the lecture demonstrates that accrual-based profit measures have greater predictive value for future performance than cash flow measures, thus helping mitigate the information gap between insiders and outsiders.

## Question 2

Based on the information presented in Lecture 1 on asset distortions, which combination of accounting distortion and its effect on financial analysis is correctly matched?

- Conservative accounting for R&D (expensing all costs) leads to understated asset turnover ratios
- Fair value accounting for operating assets leads to higher reliability but lower relevance in financial reporting
- Capitalization of all marketing expenditures creates downward bias in reported ROE ratios
- Failure to capitalize internally generated intangible assets creates an upward bias in asset turnover ratios and ROE **(correct)**

**Explanation**: Lecture 1 explains that failure to capitalize internally generated intangible assets (like R&D, brand value, and other self-created intangibles) results in understated assets on the balance sheet. This accounting treatment creates systematic distortions in financial analysis: asset turnover ratios appear artificially higher since the denominator (assets) is understated, and similarly, ROE appears inflated since equity (which reflects accumulated accounting for assets) is also understated. This makes companies with significant internally generated intangibles appear more efficient in asset utilization and more profitable than they truly are from an economic perspective. The lecture identifies this as a significant challenge when comparing companies across industries with different levels of internally generated intangible assets.

## Question 3

In the Lyft case study presented in Lecture 1, which fundamental accounting concept was most directly violated by the typographical error that caused the stock price volatility?

- The going concern principle, which assumes a company will continue operations indefinitely
- The historical cost principle, which requires assets to be recorded at original acquisition cost
- The matching principle, which requires expenses to be recorded in the same period as related revenues
- The full disclosure principle, which requires that financial statements provide all relevant information about a company's financial condition **(correct)**

**Explanation**: The Lyft case study in Lecture 1 centered around a typographical error in the company's earnings release where management incorrectly stated that they expected to improve their adjusted EBITDA margin by 500 basis points, when they actually meant 50 basis points. This error fundamentally violated the full disclosure principle, which requires that financial communications provide accurate and complete information about a company's financial condition and expectations. The stock price volatility resulted from market participants acting on misleading information. While other accounting principles like matching and accruals are discussed in Lecture 1, this specific case most directly illustrates the importance of accurate disclosure in financial communications and its material impact on capital markets, highlighting how information problems can lead to significant market reactions when distorted information is presented to investors.

## Question 4

According to Lecture 2, what are the five steps in the IFRS 15 revenue recognition model?

- Advertise the product, secure the sale, deliver the product, invoice the customer, collect payment
- Identify the contract, identify performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the price, recognize revenue when obligations are satisfied **(correct)**
- Set pricing strategy, market the product, sell the product, record the sale, report to stakeholders
- Identify the customer, determine the price, allocate resources, complete the service, collect payment

**Explanation**: According to Lecture 2, IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive five-step model for revenue recognition: (1) Identify the contract with a customer, (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) Determine the transaction price, (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

## Question 5

In a multi-element arrangement under IFRS 15, how should the transaction price be allocated to different performance obligations?

- Based on the timing of when each obligation will be fulfilled
- In proportion to the stand-alone selling prices of each performance obligation **(correct)**
- Based on management's discretion and business strategy
- Equally across all identified performance obligations

**Explanation**: Lecture 2 explains that for multi-element arrangements, IFRS 15 requires the transaction price to be allocated among the various performance obligations in proportion to their stand-alone selling prices. This ensures that revenue recognition for each component of the arrangement reflects its relative value, even when they are sold together at a discount or as part of a bundle.

## Question 6

According to Lecture 2, when using the percentage-of-completion method for a long-term project, how is revenue recognized?

- All at once when the project is completed
- When cash payments are received from the customer
- Over time, as the entity satisfies the performance obligation based on progress toward completion **(correct)**
- Only after the customer formally accepts the completed work

**Explanation**: As explained in Lecture 2, the percentage-of-completion method recognizes revenue over time by determining the ratio of costs incurred to total expected costs, reflecting the progress toward completion of the performance obligation. This method aligns with IFRS 15's principle that revenue should be recognized when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, which in long-term projects often occurs continuously as the work progresses.

# Financial Assets and Business Combinations

This section covers the accounting treatment of equity method investments, business combinations, and financial assets.

## Question 1

What determines how an investment should be accounted for according to the lecture on financial assets?

- The industry of the company making the investment
- The percentage of ownership and level of influence or control **(correct)**
- The expected return on the investment
- The location of the investee company

**Explanation**: According to the lecture, the accounting treatment for investments is determined by the level of control or influence, which is typically measured by the percentage of ownership. The lecture identifies three main levels: passive influence (<20% voting shares), significant influence (20% to 50% voting shares), and controlling influence (>50% voting shares). Each level requires a different accounting approach.

## Question 2

Which of the following statements about the equity method is correct?

- Dividends received are treated as income on the investor's income statement
- The investment remains at historical cost and is never adjusted
- The investment is adjusted for the investor's share of the investee's income, and dividends reduce the investment account **(correct)**
- The investor consolidates all of the investee's assets and liabilities

**Explanation**: As explained in the lecture, under the equity method (used for investments with significant influence), the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor's share of the investee's income. Dividends received are treated as a recovery and reduce the investment account rather than being reported as income. This reflects the economic reality that the investor is entitled to a portion of the investee's earnings.

## Question 3

What is goodwill in the context of business acquisitions?

- The reputation and brand value of the acquiring company
- The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired **(correct)**
- The combined market value of both companies after the acquisition
- The amount that appears on the acquired company's original balance sheet

**Explanation**: According to the lecture, goodwill is defined as "the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of its identifiable net assets of the full company." Goodwill represents unidentifiable assets such as reputation, customer relationships, synergies, and other intangible factors that caused the acquirer to pay more than the fair value of the identifiable net assets.

## Question 4

When using the "full goodwill method" to account for non-controlling interests (NCI), how is the amount of goodwill calculated?

- Goodwill = Purchase price - Book value of net assets
- Goodwill = Purchase price - (Book value of net assets + Hidden reserves)
- Goodwill = (Purchase price + Fair value of NCI) - Fair value of net assets **(correct)**
- Goodwill = (Purchase price + Book value of NCI) - Book value of net assets

**Explanation**: The lecture explains that under the full goodwill method, goodwill is calculated as the purchase price plus the fair value of the non-controlling interest, minus the fair value of the net assets. This approach recognizes goodwill attributable to both the controlling and non-controlling interests, hence "full" goodwill.

## Question 5

What is the difference between the "full goodwill method" and the "proportionate share of net assets" method for accounting for non-controlling interests?

- The full goodwill method requires a higher purchase price
- The full goodwill method results in higher recorded goodwill and a higher NCI value **(correct)**
- The proportionate share method is not accepted under current accounting standards
- There is no difference in the final consolidated total assets between the two methods

**Explanation**: As demonstrated in the lecture's examples, the key difference between these methods is that the full goodwill method values non-controlling interests at fair value, resulting in higher recorded goodwill and a higher NCI value compared to the proportionate share method, which values NCI based only on their share of the identifiable net assets' fair value. The lecture showed that this difference affects both the balance sheet totals and the goodwill amount.

## Question 6

What does FVTPL stand for in the context of financial asset accounting, and how are changes in fair value reported under this classification?

- Fair Value Through Profit and Loss; changes in fair value affect net income **(correct)**
- Fair Value Through Primary Leverage; changes in fair value affect leverage ratios
- Future Value Testing of Passive Liabilities; changes in value are disclosed in notes
- Fair Value Testing of Potential Losses; changes in value create loss reserves

**Explanation**: As explained in the lecture, FVTPL stands for "Fair Value Through Profit and Loss." Under this classification, investments are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, and any changes in fair value (unrealized gains or losses) are recognized directly in the income statement, affecting net income for the period.

## Question 7

How does FVOCI accounting treatment differ from FVTPL accounting treatment?

- FVOCI is used only for debt investments while FVTPL is used only for equity investments
- FVOCI recognizes fair value changes in other comprehensive income rather than in net income **(correct)**
- FVOCI applies only to controlling interests while FVTPL applies to passive investments
- FVOCI requires historical cost accounting while FVTPL requires fair value accounting

**Explanation**: The lecture contrasts FVTPL with FVOCI (Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income). The key difference is where the changes in fair value are reported. Under FVOCI, while the asset is still measured at fair value on the balance sheet, changes in fair value bypass the income statement and are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), thus not affecting net income until the asset is sold.

## Question 8

What is the process of consolidation when a parent company purchases 100% of a subsidiary that has hidden reserves in its non-current assets?

- The parent simply adds all the subsidiary's assets and liabilities at their book values
- The parent recognizes goodwill equal to the full purchase price minus the book value of net assets
- The parent revalues the subsidiary's assets to recognize hidden reserves, with the remaining excess purchase price recorded as goodwill **(correct)**
- The parent maintains separate accounting records with no consolidation adjustments

**Explanation**: The lecture explains that in the consolidation process, when hidden reserves exist (assets carried at less than fair value), these assets must be revalued to their fair value as part of purchase accounting. The allocation process follows this order: first, adjust the book value of tangible assets to fair value (recognizing hidden reserves); second, identify and assign value to identifiable intangible assets; and finally, any remaining excess is recognized as goodwill. This ensures that all assets are properly valued in the consolidated statements.
